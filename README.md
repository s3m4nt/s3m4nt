### I am a full-stack software engineer. For the past 10 years I have been at the forefront of digital evolution, combining software, audio and multimedia, but my true passion is building web applications. 

Utilizing my design background, I build visually engaging applications. My tools are Adobe Creative Suite, HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. 

I have a team-oriented attitude, a passion for technology, and seek a role at a company where I can continue to thrive as a developer.
